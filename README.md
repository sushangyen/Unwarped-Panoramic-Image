# Unwarped-Panoramic-Image
In this project, I unwarp the panormaic image with OpenCV and transfer it into the perspective-view image. With the program, the distortion problem in 2-D panorama image could be removed. I only released few of my source code due to the confidentiality agreement from my company. To read the full version report, please check the link in the bottom.
